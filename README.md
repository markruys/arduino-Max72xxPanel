Max72xxPanel
============

An Arduino library for controlling a canvas of sets of 8x8 LEDs driven by MAX7219 or MAX7221 controllers. [Kits][hardware] sold for below 10 USD.

This is a plugin for Adafruit's core graphics library GFX, providing basic graphics primitives (points, lines, circles, characters, etc.). So besides this library, you need to download and install [Adafruit_GFX][gfx-download], *dated Jul 5th, 2013 or more recent*.

Installation
------------

Place the [Max72xxPanel][download] and [Adafruit_GFX][gfx-download] library folders in your `<arduinosketchfolder>/libraries/` folder. You may need to create the `libraries` subfolder if its your first library. Restart the Arduino IDE. 


Features
--------
- Double buffering to prevent screen flicker. Check out our example for usage.
- Support for multiple matrix displays, positioned in an arbitrary rectangular layout. You can define both the order as the rotation of each display.
- Uses the [SPI library][spi] to address the display(s) connected in cascade.
- Low memory footprint.
- Fast, no use of NOOP's.
- Cyrillic font.

Usage
-----

Read [overview][gfx-docs] for instructions how to use Adafruit_GFX. Check out our [examples][examples] to get some inspiration. Note that to update your displays, you need to explicitely call write().

At YouTube, you'll find a [ticker tape][tickertape] and [snake] demo.
